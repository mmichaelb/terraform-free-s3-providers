=== Credentials

You have to create a new API key following this tutorial: https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/ (either a global API key for your whole account or using a pre-defined application bearer). Following that, the project and organization id have to be retrieved (https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization-id and https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/concepts/#project).
