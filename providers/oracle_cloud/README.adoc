=== Credentials

You have to create an API key following this tutorial: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformproviderconfiguration.htm. +
Keep in mind that the user associated with the API key needs at least the following permissions (given using policies):

* `Allow group <your group> to manage all-resources in compartment <your compartment name>`
* `Allow group <your group> to manage users in tenancy where target.user.name = /<your bucket name>-*/`
* `Allow group <your group> to manage groups in tenancy where target.group.name = /<your bucket name>-*/`
