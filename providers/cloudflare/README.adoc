== Cloudflare R2

=== Usage

The following code snippet can be used.

[source,terraform]
----
module "cloudflare" {
  source      = "github.com/mmichaelb/terraform-free-s3-providers/providers/cloudflare"
  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  account_id  = "<your account id>"
  region      = "WEUR"
}

provider "cloudflare" {
  api_token = "<your api key>"
}
----

=== Credentials

You have to create a new API token following this tutorial: https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/[]. You have to *select the template "Create Additional Tokens"* in order for the token to be usable. The token needs the following permissions:

* User's Account - `Workers R2 Storage:Edit`
* All users - `API Tokens:Edit`

Furthermore, you need to retrieve the account id of your account (the account, the Bucket should be created in). See this tutorial for further assistance: https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/
